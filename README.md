Public Overview
This project focuses on building an efficient and user-friendly image classification pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the pre-trained MobileNet model. The system is designed to enable real-time predictions through an interactive web application built with Streamlit. Users can upload images directly through the app, which then classifies the images using a fine-tuned version of the MobileNet model.

Key Features
Custom CNN Architecture

Designed a tailored CNN model for specific image classification tasks.
Explored different architectural designs to improve feature extraction and prediction accuracy.
Integration of MobileNet

Utilized the MobileNet model, a pre-trained, lightweight, and efficient deep learning architecture.
Fine-tuned MobileNet on domain-specific datasets to enhance its classification performance on customized tasks.
Streamlit-Based Web Application

Developed a web interface using Streamlit to provide a seamless user experience.
Features include:
Simple drag-and-drop functionality for uploading images.
Real-time classification results displayed with prediction confidence scores.
Model Training and Deployment

Trained both the custom CNN and the fine-tuned MobileNet model on labeled datasets.
Evaluated performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployed the trained model into the Streamlit application for public or organizational use.
Versatile Applications

The pipeline can be extended to a wide range of domains, such as:
Object Recognition: Identifying objects in images.
Medical Imaging: Classifying medical images like X-rays or MRI scans.
Wildlife Monitoring: Recognizing species in nature conservation projects.
